## "Professional" things to know about me

I enjoy personality tests and learning about myself, and yes I do understand that these sorts of tests aren't terribly rigorous, but they do provide thinking points:

Myers-Briggs - *(I,E)NFP* - So I'm either a Campaigner or a Mediator, depending on the day, both of which deal largely with the human side of things, always looking for connectedness.  Lately I've tended much more to the I side of things.

DISC - S *(Steadiness)* - I don't have recessives on this one, just straight S.  What does that mean? It means I'm calm, I am motivated by the story more than the outcome, and I need time to formulate answers/opinions and require context.  If you want my time, please include the "why" so that I don't panic. 

Strengths Finder - 
  1. *Adaptability* - _People exceptionally talented in the Adaptability theme prefer to go with the flow. They tend to be “now” people who take things as they come and discover the future one day at a time._
  2. *Connectedness* -  _People exceptionally talented in the Connectedness theme have faith in the links among all things. They believe there are few coincidences and that almost every event has meaning._
  3. *Developer* - _People exceptionally talented in the Developer theme recognize and cultivate the potential in others. They spot the signs of each small improvement and derive satisfaction from evidence of progress._
  4. *Empathy* - _People exceptionally talented in the Empathy theme can sense other people’s feelings by imagining themselves in others’ lives or situations._
  5. *Intellection* - _People exceptionally talented in the Intellection theme are characterized by their intellectual activity. They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions._

### so what does that mean?

I love good conversation and have difficulties with small talk because it's not thought provoking, however I recognize the social importance of it as a gateway and "litmus test" to determine if deeper conversation should proceed. 
I lean hard on Empathy and Connectedness in my professional and personal lives. This often makes it difficult for me to not help out people/teams when there are issues, even if they are out of my hands.
Adaptability is more of weakness for me as negative patterns are easily over-looked and become "meh, that's how it is" unless acted upon asap. "out of sight out of mind" is very real for me. It also means that I'm not a terribly great future planner as I take things day by day; see also INFP. 
Please don't surprise me at work with meetings if it can be avoided. Give me time and context to prepare.  
Related, you might not get my best answers immediately as I run every conversation around in my head for an agonizingly long time. 
I require feedback and inclusion.  Feedback is more than "this is good, this is bad", it's a tool that we can use to build connection and trust.

## Personal things

These are difficult to detangle from professional as I've realized that not being myself in my professional life causes me large amounts of stress and difficulty. So, I'm me in most situations. 

As is evident from irl meeting, I'm interested in body modification, primarily approaching it from cultural and ritual curiousity than from artistic endeavor nowadays. I'm always down to talk human body and the "strange" things that we do to them for vanity or inclusion or identity or what have you.  Going highly visible with tattoos helped me to "become" a complete person in my professional career as I could no longer hide this aspect of me, so I had to embrace it and you either get me or you don't.

I enjoy reading about politics and ideologies that exist outside of the modern Western very narrow views, and will gladly engage in conversations about all sorts of taboo topics because of this. I love seeing the other side and am fairly adept at understanding other viewpoints even if I don't agree with them, and am happy to learn more about them (see also Mediator above).  

I'm a father and together w/ my wife we have 2 kiddos, so work life balance is very important to me, with life always winning.  Not to say that I won't work hard or stay a little late, but it's on my own terms and thus for me to decide, not you to dictate.

Vegan and Straight Edge. Both of these were more or less born out of empathy for me. I do my best to not preach or be a jerk about either of them. They are my personal decisions.

I play a lot of old school Magic the Gathering. I run a website about it, http://geoCitiesofBrass.com, and am continually working to foster and grow a community in the Greater Toronto Area.

Oh, I'm also a Canadian immigrant/USA emmigrant.
